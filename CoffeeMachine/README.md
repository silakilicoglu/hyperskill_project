# COFFEE MACHINE

This [project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/68) is part of the Python Core and Introductory Machine Learning in Python track from Hyperskill.

## Learning Outcomes

This project allows you to get a taste of Python. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python.

## About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. 

In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

### *Example*
#
Your coffee machine should have the same initial resources as in the example (400 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffee beans, 9 disposable cups, $550 in cash).\ 
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
